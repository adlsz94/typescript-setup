 *? Union Types
 * 
 * Typescript's type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using
 * a large variety of operators. 
 * Now that we know how to write a few types, it's time to start combining them in
 * interesting ways.
 * 
 *? Defining a Union Type
 * 
 * The first way to combining types you might see is a union type. 
 * A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values
 * that may be any one of those types.
 * We refer to each of these types as the union's members.
 * Let's write a function that can operate on strings or numbers:
 */

function printId( id: number | string ) {
    console.log('You ID is: ' + id)
}
// OK
printId(101) // return You ID is: 101
// OK
printId('202') // return You ID is: 202

//* printId({myId: 22342}) 
//! error: Argument of type '{ myId: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.

/**
 *? Working with Union Types
 * 
 * It's easy to provide a value matching a union type - simply provide a type matching
 * any of the union's members. If you have a value of a union type, how do you work with it?
 * Typescript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of the union.
 * For example, if you have the union string | number, you can't use methods that are only
 * available on string: 
 */

/**
 **  function printId1(id: number | string) {
 **   console.log(id.toUppercase())
} */
/**
 *! error: Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
 *! Property 'toUppercase' does not exist on type 'number'.
 */

/**
 * The solution is to narrow the union with code, the same as you would in Javascript
 * without type annotations. Narrowing occurs when Typescript can deduce
 * a more specific type for a value based on the structure of the code.
 * For example, Typescript knows that only a string value will have a typeof value 'string:
 */

function printId1(id: number | string) {
    if (typeof id === 'string') {
        // In this branch, id is of type 'string'
        console.log('Your ID of type string is: '+id.toUpperCase())
    } else {
        // Here, id is of type 'number'
        console.log('Your ID is: '+id)
    }
}

console.log(printId1(150))   // return You ID is: 150
                             // undefined
console.log(printId1('200')) // return Your ID of type string is: 200
                             // undefined

// Another example is to use a function like Array.isArray:

function welcomePeople( x: string[] | string ) {
    if (Array.isArray(x)) {
        // Here, 'x' is of type'string[]'
        // TODO: See the link: https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join
        console.log('Hello, '+x.join(' and')) 
    } else {
        // Here, 'x' is of type 'string'
        console.log( 'Welcome '+ x )
    }
}
welcomePeople( 'Developer Javascript and Typescript' ) // undefined
                                                       // Welcome Developer Javascript and Typescript
welcomePeople([ 'Developer Javascript', ' Typescript' ]) // Hello, Developer Javascript and Typescript

/**
 * Notice that in the 'else' branch, we don't need to do anything special - if 'x' wasn't a 'string[]',
 * then it must have been a 'string'.
 * 
 * Sometimes you'll have a union where all the members have something in common.
 * For example, both arrays and strings have a 'slice' method. 
 * If every member in a union has a property in common, you can use that property without narrowing: 
 */

// Return type is inferred as number[] | string
function getFirstThree(x: number[] | string ) {
    // TODO: See the link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
    return x.slice(0, 3)
}
console.log(getFirstThree([1, 2, 3, 4])) // return [ 1, 2, 3 ]

console.log(getFirstThree('55')) // return 55

/**
 * It might be confusing that a union of types appears to have the intersection of those typesâ€™ properties. 
 * This is not an accident - the name union comes from type theory. The union number | string is composed by 
 * taking the union of the values from each type. Notice that given two sets with corresponding facts about each set, 
 * only the intersection of those facts applies to the union of the sets themselves. 
 * For example, if we had a room of tall people wearing hats, and another room of Spanish speakers wearing hats, 
 * after combining those rooms, the only thing we know about every person is that they must be wearing a hat.

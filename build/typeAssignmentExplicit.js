 *? Type Assignment
 *
 * When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:
 **  Explicit
 **  Implicit
 *
 * In both examples below firstName is of type string
 *
 *? Explicit Type
 *! Explicit type assignment are easier to read and more intentional.
 *
 * Explicit - writing out the type:
 */
let firstName = 'Dilan';
console.log(typeof firstName);
